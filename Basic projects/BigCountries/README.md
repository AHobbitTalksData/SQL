The challenge consists of the following instructions:

*A country is big if:*

*1) It has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or*
*2) It has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).* 
*Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries. Return the result table in any order.* 

My solution can be found in the code above. You will find that I created a database, the table, added information to the columns and filtered in order to only show the information that meeets the requirements.

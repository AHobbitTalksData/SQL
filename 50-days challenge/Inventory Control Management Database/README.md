Database taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset

The questions I will be working on are: 

- Which year had the highest sales?

- How was the weather during the year of highest sales?

- Conclude whether the weather has an essential impact on sales.

- Do the sales always rise near the holiday season for all the years?

- Analyze the relationship between sales and the different macroeconomic variables in the dataset.
